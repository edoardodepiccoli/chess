# Chess CLI Ruby Game

This is a simple, text-based Chess game built in Ruby, created as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) curriculum. The game runs in your terminal, and you can play against another player directly through the command line.

## Getting Started

To play the game:
1. Navigate to the `lib` folder in your terminal.
2. Run the game with the command:
   ```bash
   ruby main.rb
   ```

## Project Goals and Future Enhancements

This project began as a learning exercise in object-oriented programming and has evolved into one of my favourite portfolio projects. After completing an initial version, I decided to rewrite the project to improve its modularity and make it easier to extend with new features. Planned updates include:

- **Game Serialization**: Save and load game states to resume play at any time.
- **Code Refactoring**: Further refine the codebase by making `Board` methods private to better adhere to object-oriented programming principles.
- **Algebraic Notation**: Add support for algebraic notation to make moves more intuitive and closer to standard chess notation.

## Lessons Learned

Creating this game was a huge learning experience. I gained a lot of insight into breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces, even when it involved trial and error. Each mistake turned into a valuable lesson, teaching me how to approach future coding challenges with patience and strategy.

## Reflection

Iâ€™m proud of the progress made in this project, but it also feels like just the beginning of my journey into object-oriented programming in Ruby. There's a lot more to learn and implement, and I look forward to refining my skills further.
