# Chess

Welcome to my totally broken CLI chess game! Just a heads-up: this thing is still a huge work in progress. Honestly, it’s so janky and has so many missing features that you probably shouldn’t even think about downloading it right now.

But here’s the deal—I plan to come back to it later and make it better! Here’s what’s on my to-do list:

1. Refactor the heck out of this code.
2. Embrace Test-Driven Development (TDD) and test every possible scenario.
3. Make it more modular and easier to maintain.
4. Add all those missing features that are currently just floating around in my head.

Feel free to poke around the files and check out the commits (spoiler alert: they’re pretty unprofessional).

So, yeah—don’t take this project too seriously for now. It’s a messy work in progress, and I know it needs a complete overhaul. But if you’re curious, dive in and have a look :)
